# Dog Emotion Classifier üê∂üé≠

This project uses PyTorch for model development and Gradio for the user interface to classify the emotions of dogs from images. The classifier identifies emotions as happy, sad, angry, or relaxed.

## Features

- **Model Architecture:** Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50 model.
- **User Interface:** Interactive web interface powered by Gradio.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Scripts for training and evaluating the model on custom datasets.

## Dataset

- The model was trained on the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danielshanbalico/dog-emotion dataset.

## Installation
